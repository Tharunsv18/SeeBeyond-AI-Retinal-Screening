## AI-Assisted Diabetic Retinopathy Screening and Retinal Lesion Localization

SeeBeyond is an AI-assisted retinal screening prototype designed to analyze
fundus images using a multi-stage artificial intelligence pipeline.

The system combines:

- Image quality assessment
- Fundus image enhancement
- Diabetic retinopathy severity classification
- Retinal blood vessel segmentation
- Retinal lesion localization
- Explainable AI outputs
- Automated screening report generation
- Graphical user interface for end-to-end analysis

# 1. Problem

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major complication of diabetes that can lead
to preventable vision loss when not detected early.

Manual retinal screening requires trained professionals and can be difficult
to scale, especially in locations where specialist access is limited.

SeeBeyond aims to provide an AI-assisted screening workflow that can analyze
a retinal fundus image and provide:

1. Image quality information
2. DR severity estimation
3. AI-based retinal structure and lesion localization
4. A structured screening report

The system is designed as a research and hackathon prototype.
